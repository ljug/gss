This solved it:

jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/fus?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&characterSetResults=UTF-8

so this was wrong:

jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/fus?useUnicode=true&connectionCollation=utf8_general_ci&characterSetResults=utf8

When using Glassfish, you can set these properties as additional to your JDBC Connection Pools. Locate and view your database connection in Web Administration (Resources->JDBC Connection Pools->your.connection). In additional properties tab add (if there are not present yet) mentioned properties and restart your server:

//name, value
characterEncoding, UTF-8
characterSetResults, UTF-8
useUnicode, true
The result will be the same if parameters are added to URL, but this is more maintainable solution in my opinion.
